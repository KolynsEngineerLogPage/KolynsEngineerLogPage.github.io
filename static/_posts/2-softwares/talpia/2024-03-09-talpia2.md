Prerequisite: Basic Python


<br>
<br>
Hello there! This is the second part of me learning python by coding a simple pixel art editor. To recap, I made a working pixel art canvas with python’s tkinter framework.

However, as you probably have noticed, this editor is not interesting. First of all, the users can only draw black pixels. Secondly, there is no way to erase the drawing.

Luckily, both problems can be solved by implementing a color picker and that is exactly what I'm going to do today.

*Credit: pyqt colorpicker*


Again, one of the advantages of using python is because of its rich library base. There are at least dozens of open-source libraries of color picker available on GitHub, but ultimately I was settled with [this one](https://github.com/nlfmt/pyqt-colorpicker.git).


Install vcolorpicker
{% highlight shell %}
pip install vcolorpicker
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing to do is to get a color. A color can be interpreted in different ways, but the most common way to represent it is using the RGB color system ({{ "Red" | colorize: "red" }} {{ "Green" | colorize: "green" }} {{ "Blue" | colorize: "blue" }} color system).

It can either look like


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
# Decimal code
 R    G    B
(255, 255, 255)
{% endhighlight %}


or


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
# Hex code
#FFFFFF

 (R) (G) (B)
#(FF)(FF)(FF)
{% endhighlight %}


Both represent color white. 

Now it's time to invoke the color-picking menu. To do so, I'll import the `getColor()` function from the `vcolorpicker` library.


{% highlight python %}
from vcolorpicker import getColor
getColor()
{% endhighlight %}


Press run, get


![vcolorpicker-interface](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/2/vcolorpicker-interface.png)


That was a quick setup. Now I can enter number to the RGB field between range [0, 255] to get different colors. What `getColor()` does is to pick a RGB color, and represent it as (decimal, decimal, decimal). This can be verified with the following code


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
print(getColor())
{% endhighlight %}


If nothing is done and ‘OK’ button is pressed, the terminal would print (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) instead.

Why does this matter? Well, remember this function?


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
def set_color(self, event=None):
    self.canvas.itemconfig(self.id, fill='black')
{% endhighlight %}


It would be great if ‘black’ can be replaced with our chosen color. However, before doing that, I need to convert the color into hex code. To do so


{% highlight python %}
from vcolorpicker import getColor
from vcolorpicker import rgb2hex

getColor()
# optional
print(f'#{rgb2hex(getColor())}')
{% endhighlight %}


Now the terminal will print #000000 instead. This is the same thing as (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), but the fill prop does not work with decimal codes so I need to convert it into hex first.

Now, as you probably have noticed, our canvas will not open if `getColor()` is directly invoked. This indicates that I need a trigger in my editor, and a button would be prefect for this task.

Time to learn how to create a button in tkinter. I know it has been a while we have not talked about the editor itself. To recap, the editor consists two parts: its base and a canvas. The canvas is where the user draws pixels. However, in this case, I will put a button on the base.


{% highlight python %}
from vcolorpicker import getColor
from vcolorpicker import rgb2hex
import tkinter as tk

button = tk.Button(base
                   text='pick',
                   command=getColor)
button.config(width=2, height=1)
button.place(x=300, y=700)
{% endhighlight %}


Get


![pick-button](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/2/pick-button.png)


After clicking on the 'pick' button


![after-click-pick](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/2/after-click-pick.png)


Now it's time to modify the `set_color()` function we have. Oh wait, I suddenly realized that the hex color code is not being stored anywhere. To fix that, I will modify the button’s command.


{% highlight python %}
from vcolorpicker import getColor
from vcolorpicker import rgb2hex
import tkinter as tk

base_height = 800
base_width = 600
theme_color = '#383838'
canvas_len = 512
outline_width = 2
grid_len = 32
sqsize = canvas_len / grid_len
color = '#FFFFFF'

def pick_color():
    global color
    color = f'#{rgb2hex(getColor())}'

button = tk.Button(base
                   text='pick',
                   command=pick_color)
button.config(width=2, height=1)
button.place(x=300, y=700)
{% endhighlight %}


The color value will be modified after `getColor()` returns a result (when the ‘OK’ button in color picker is pressed). Now we can go back to `set_color()` function.


{% highlight python %}
class OnePixel:
    def __init__(self, m_canvas, pixel_row, pixel_col,
                 start_x, start_y, size, outline, width):
        self.canvas = m_canvas
        self.id = self.canvas.create_rectangle((start_x,
                                                start_y,
                                                start_x + size,
                                                start_y + size),
                                               fill="white",
                                               outline=outline,
                                               width=width)
        self.canvas.tag_bind(self.id, "<ButtonPress-1>", self.set_color)
        self.row = pixel_row
        self.col = pixel_col

    def set_color(self, event=None):
        self.canvas.itemconfig(self.id, fill=color)
{% endhighlight %}

The editor just acquired the ability to paint different colors!

I've learned something today, how about you?
