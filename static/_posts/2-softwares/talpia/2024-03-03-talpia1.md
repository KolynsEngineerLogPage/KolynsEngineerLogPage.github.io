Prerequisite: Basic Python


<br>
<br>
Python is the first language I learned at school and it is a shame that I have never code in python after my very first CS class. Recently, I have been into ML so I decided to pick up python again. In my experience, doing projects is the fastest way to gain knowledge about a programming language. This time, I choose to replicate the dotpict! pixel art editor.

It is an app that allows its users to draw pixel arts (of course). It used to be my favorite pixel art editor until I purchased Aseprite but dotpict! still has its advantages over Aseprite such as being free, featuring user artworks, and working on phones. I can say dotpict! is a great starter for pixel arts.


So, what do I need to make this editor? The first thing comes into my mind is to pick a good python GUI framework. After a quick googling, I found the following:

After playing with the framework and python, I was able to create a window and put a canvas inside it.


![blank-app](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/blank-app.png)


{% highlight python %}
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
window.title('talpia by Kolyn Lin')
window.geometry(f"{600}x{800}")

base = tk.Canvas(window, bg='#FFFFFF')
base.config(width=600, height=800)
base.pack()

window.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}


I think this is quite similar to Java’s swing framework, which I have more experience with.


{% highlight java %}
// Java (Don't copy)
JFrame window = new JFrame();
window.setOpacity(1f);
window.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
window.setTitle("talpia by Kolyn Lin");
window.setSize(600, 800);

Container container = window.getContentPane();
container.setBackground((new Color(255, 255, 255)));
container.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(600, 800));

window.setVisible(true);
{% endhighlight %}


![blank-app-java](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/blank-app-java.png)


*The same thing in Java Swing.*


As a good programming practice, I do not want magic numbers, so I decided to replace the integers with variables. Besides that, I also made the theme color into a variable.


{% highlight python %}
import tkinter as tk

base_height = 800
base_width = 600
theme_color = '#FFFFFF'

window = tk.Tk()
window.resizable(False, False)
window.title('talpia by Kolyn Lin')
window.geometry(f"{base_width}x{base_height}")

base = tk.Canvas(window, bg=theme_color)
base.config(width=base_width, height=base_height)
base.pack()
{% endhighlight %}


One thing I am still not getting used to is that there is literally nothing next to python variables besides the assignment. There is no type, no var. Come to think of it, I found it strange that UMass Boston was teaching their first year CS majors python and there is no type indications in python. Types are fundamental in programming!

OK, back to the editor. Now I realize that I need a canvas. I know that a canvas for pixel art can be done using squares, so naturally I should learn how to draw a square.


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
rect = base.create_rectangle((100, 100, 200, 200), fill='blue')
{% endhighlight %}


Result:


![blue-square](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/blue-square.png)


I found this to be interesting. Rather than defining width and height for a rectangle, tkinter uses two points to represent it.


![two-points](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/two-points.png)


In tkinter, it is actually:


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)

                              x0   y0   x1   y1
rect = base.create_rectangle((100, 100, 200, 200), fill='blue')
{% endhighlight %}


Whereas in Java swing, we do indicate width and height. Now I am not going to post Java examples because this is a post about python.

Having acquired the knowledge of creating one square. The next thing naturally follows is to create a grid. To do so, a double for-loop is the best choice. However, before that, I have to make define the area where the canvas is going to be placed.


{% highlight python %}
import tkinter as tk

base_height = 800
base_width = 600
theme_color = '#383838'
canvas_len = 512

window = tk.Tk()
window.resizable(False, False)
window.title('talpia by Kolyn Lin')
window.geometry(f"{base_width}x{base_height}")

base = tk.Canvas(window, bg=theme_color)
base.config(width=base_width, height=base_height)
base.pack()

canvas = tk.Canvas(base, bg='white')
canvas = config(width=canvas_len, height=canvas_len)
canvas.place(x=(base_width-canvas_len)/2,
             y=(base_height-canvas_len)/8)

window.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}


Here I have re-assigned the theme color to #383838 (Dark gray), created a Canvas called ‘canvas’ and put it inside the base Canvas (canvas inside canvas). Now it looks like the following:


![interface1](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/interface1.png)


Great! The next to do is to put squares inside it. I would like to use the square’s outline color to resemble a grid. Like this:


![blue-square2](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/blue-square2.png)


But we want the inner color to be white and outline color to be light gray. After adjusting the outline width, we get:


![square](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/square.png)


Now I will define a few more variables.


{% highlight python %}
import tkinter as tk

base_height = 800
base_width = 600
theme_color = '#383838'
canvas_len = 512
outline_width = 2
grid_len = 4
sqsize = canvas_len / grid_len

window = tk.Tk()
window.resizable(False, False)
window.title('talpia by Kolyn Lin')
window.geometry(f"{base_width}x{base_height}")

base = tk.Canvas(window, bg=theme_color)
base.config(width=base_width, height=base_height)
base.pack()

canvas = tk.Canvas(base, bg='white')
canvas = config(width=canvas_len, height=canvas_len)
canvas.place(x=(base_width-canvas_len)/2,
             y=(base_height-canvas_len)/8)

window.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}


To create a grid, I will use a double for-loop to create squares. Our code is getting long here so I have chosen to omit some contents.


{% highlight python %}
for row in range(grid_len):
    for col in range(grid_len):
        x0 = row * sqsize
        y0 = col * sqsize
        x1 = (row+1) * sqsize
        y1 = (col+1) * sqsize
        rect = canvas.create_rectangle((x0, y0, x1, y1),
                                       fill='white',
                                       width=2,
                                       outline='gray')
{% endhighlight %}


Now we have the grid!


![grid](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/grid.png)


The grid is a little off the margin. After a bit trial-and-errors, I found out that moving every square to (3, 3) solves the problem:


{% highlight python %}
for row in range(grid_len):
    for col in range(grid_len):
        x0 = row * sqsize + 3
        y0 = col * sqsize + 3
        x1 = (row+1) * sqsize+3
        y1 = (col+1) * sqsize+3
        rect = canvas.create_rectangle((x0, y0, x1, y1),
                                       fill='white',
                                       width=2,
                                       outline='gray')
{% endhighlight %}


![grid-2](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/grid-2.png)


This method works when the outline width equals to 2. After trying, I found it hard to tell when the grid is going to perfectly fit into the canvas. In this case, it is. If I modify the grid to 32 x 32:


{% highlight python %}
base_height = 800
base_width = 600
theme_color = '#383838'
canvas_len = 512
outline_width = 2
grid_len = 32
sqsize = canvas_len / grid_len
{% endhighlight %}


![grid-3](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/grid-3.png)


It still fits perfectly. Anyway, my purpose is not to determine the ultimate solution to fit the grid into the canvas so I will continue making the editor.

The next thing I want to do is to actually color a square by clicking on it. It can be done using tag bind.


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
canvas.tag_bind(rect, "<ButtonPress-1>", clicked)
{% endhighlight %}


I grabbed this from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42185914)


Now I define a set_color function to replace the clicked function,


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
def set_color(*args):
    canvas.itemconfig(args[0], fill='black')
{% endhighlight %}


By the way, itemconfig is from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13212501)

Then I pass this function into tag bind.


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
canvas.tag_bind(rect, "<ButtonPress-1>", set_color)
{% endhighlight %}


After I run it, I found that it doesn’t work and everything stays the same after I click on a square.

Maybe I forgot the parameters?


{% highlight python %}
# Example (Don't copy)
canvas.tag_bind(rect, "<ButtonPress-1>", set_color(rect))
{% endhighlight %}


I was greeted with this:


![grid-4](/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/1/grid-4.png)


After more online surfing, I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37062322), I then made some modifications to the class OneSquare which is suggested in the answer.


{% highlight python %}
class OnePixel:
    def __init__(self, m_canvas, pixel_row, pixel_col,
                 start_x, start_y, size, outline, width):
        self.canvas = m_canvas
        self.id = self.canvas.create_rectangle((start_x,
                                                start_y,
                                                start_x + size,
                                                start_y + size),
                                               fill="white",
                                               outline=outline,
                                               width=width)
        self.canvas.tag_bind(self.id, "<ButtonPress-1>", self.set_color)
        self.row = pixel_row
        self.col = pixel_col

    def set_color(self, event=None):
        self.canvas.itemconfig(self.id, fill='black')
{% endhighlight %}


Great! Now instead of creating a rectangle, I can create a square.


{% highlight python %}
for row in range(grid_len):
    for col in range(grid_len):
        x0 = row * sqsize + 3
        y0 = col * sqsize + 3
        rect = OnePixel(canvas, row, col,
                        x0, y0, sqsize, 'gray', outline_width)
{% endhighlight %}


Moreover, now I can paint black color.

Thank you for reading. Stay tunned for update!
