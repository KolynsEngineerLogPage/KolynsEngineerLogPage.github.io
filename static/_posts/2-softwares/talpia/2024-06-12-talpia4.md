Prerequisite: Basic Python


<br>
<br>
Dear readers, it has been two month since my last tutorial. Don’t worry, I’m still here!

Just to jog your memory (and mine), my goal to make a pixel art editor like "dotpict!". Well, that was the plan. A bit back, I dove into adding some transparency to Talpia, and today, I'm gonna show you what I dug up.

For starter, the plain white background needs to be changed to a transparent one. Like this:


<img src="/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/4/thumb.png" alt="transparent-background" width="150" height="150">


Looking familiar? I will show you how to generate this transparent background via program.

Firstly, notice that the background only has two kinds of colors: [135, 135, 135] (dark) and [186, 186, 186] (light), and they are arranged like a standard Chess board.

After we observe further, we can find that the dark blocks only appear in positions where both row and column are even or odd. The rest of them are light blocks.

Now, I will create a new file and name it `transparent_bg.py`. Inside it, write a function to create the background:


{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def create_bg(length, times2, gray1, gray2):
    bg = np.zeros([length, length, 3], dtype=np.uint8)

    for row in range(length):
        for col in range(length):
            if ((row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 0) or
                    (row % 2 == 1 and col % 2 == 1)):
                bg[row, col] = gray1
            else:
                bg[row, col] = gray2
    return bg
{% endhighlight %}


Here, `create_bg()`’s parameter `length` is the total number of dark and light blocks in an edge. The background is assumed to be a square. In addition, the transparent background example I showed to you previously has a length of 4.

The parameter `times2`, please don’t worry about it for now.

`gray1` is the first color and `gray2` is the second color.

Next, we can call this function:


{% highlight python %}
transparent_bg = create_bg(4, 0, [135, 135, 135], [186, 186, 186])
print(transparent_bg)
{% endhighlight %}


The command line will display a numpy array.

To verify that we have the correct background, I will save the array as an image. Remember that `save_arr_as_png()` function we wrote earlier? Now it’s a good time to move it to its own file:

Create a new file, and name it `save_img.py`. Inside it, add:


{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def save_arr_as_png(arr, filename):
    modified_arr = np.rot90(arr, k=1)
    modified_arr = np.flip(modified_arr, axis=0)
    image = Image.fromarray(modified_arr)
    image.save(f"{filename}.png")
{% endhighlight %}


Go back to `drawboard.py`, replace the old `save_arr_as_png()` function with


{% highlight python %}
from save_img import save_arr_as_png

def save():
    save_arr_as_png(arr, "talpia")

button3 = tk.Button(base,
                    text='save',
                    command=save)
{% endhighlight %}


Go back to `transparent_bg.py`, add


{% highlight python %}
from save_img import save_arr_as_png

transparent_bg = create_bg(4, 0, [135, 135, 135], [186, 186, 186])
print(transparent_bg)
save_arr_as_png(transparent_bg, "bg")
{% endhighlight %}


Run `transparent_bg.py`, we get a 4 x 4 pixels “transparent background” called “bg.png”

That’s too small. I will resize it to 64 x 64 pixels. Now we will be using that `times2` parameter I introduced earlier.


{% highlight python %}
def create_bg(length, times2, gray1, gray2):
    def resize_array(array):
        return array.repeat(2, axis=0).repeat(2, axis=1)

    bg = np.zeros([length, length, 3], dtype=np.uint8)

    for row in range(length):
        for col in range(length):
            if ((row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 0) or
                    (row % 2 == 1 and col % 2 == 1)):
                bg[row, col] = gray1
            else:
                bg[row, col] = gray2

    for _ in range(times2):
        bg = resize_array(bg)

    return bg
{% endhighlight %}

The `resize_array()` function essentially turns one pixel to two by two (four) pixels. Therefore, after we call it once, 4 x 4 pixels will be 8 x 8 pixels. And if we keep calling it 4 times, we will get 64 x 64 pixels. The parameter `times2` decides the number of times `resize_array()` will be called.


{% highlight python %}
transparent_bg = create_bg(4, 4, [135, 135, 135], [186, 186, 186])
{% endhighlight %}


Now we end up with:


<img src="/static/img/2-softwares/talpia/4/thumb.png" alt="transparent-background" width="150" height="150">


That’s all for today. I haven’t figure out a good way to implement layers yet. But don’t worry! I will write another tutorial after I made some new progress.
