Prerequisite: Know how to use a computer and perform online searches


<br>
<br>
Hello, there. Ever wondered how to build a blogging website like the one you are seeing now? If so, you have came to the right place! Let me tell you a secret: <u>it only took me two days from zero knowledge about web hosting to keep it running.</u> Wanna know how to do that? Keep reading and learn!


## The first thing
This site uses GitHub Pages. You should be aware that GitHub Pages are mainly used for writing blogs or project wikis. These pages are static, meaning they display the same content to every user. If your goal is to build a dynamic page website (content change based on user actions or data retrieval from database), you will need to avoid using GitHub Pages. 

## Use other tools as guidance
Let's face it, you are going to encounter many problems and so did I when I first started this project. That's why I highly recommend using AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to suggest possible fixes for you. In this article I will be teaching you what I know about GitHub websites. 

## Getting the website running
# Step 1
In this tutorial I am going to assume you have no background knowledge regarding programming. So the first step will be <u>downloading an IDE</u> so that you can view the files better. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a software that has tools needed for software development in one place. It's OK if you don't understand what I am saying. You'll do better once you try it out yourself. Different programmers might have different IDE preferences. I, for one, use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) the most often. It is also currently what I'm using to write this article. 

If you don't have a specific preference, go ahead and download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
