Prerequisite: Know how to use a computer and perform online searches


<br>
<br>
Hello, there. Ever wondered how to build a blogging website like the one you are seeing now? If so, you have came to the right place! Let me tell you a secret: <u>it only took me two days from zero knowledge about web hosting to keep it running.</u> Wanna know how to do that? Keep reading and learn!


## The first thing
This site uses GitHub Pages. You should be aware that GitHub Pages are mainly used for writing blogs or project wikis. These pages are static, meaning they display the same content to every user. If your goal is to build a dynamic page website (content change based on user actions or data retrieval from database), you will need to avoid using GitHub Pages. 

## Use other tools as guidance
Let's face it, you are going to encounter many problems and so did I when I first started this project. That's why I highly recommend using AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to suggest possible fixes for you. In this article I will be teaching you what I know about GitHub websites. 

## Getting the website running
# Step 1
In this tutorial I am going to assume you have no background knowledge regarding programming. So the first step will be <u>downloading an IDE</u> so that you can view the files better. IDE stands for **Integrated Development Environment**. It's a software that has tools needed for software development in one place. It's OK if you don't understand what I am saying. You'll do better once you try it out yourself. Different programmers might have different IDE preferences. I, for one, use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) the most often. It is also currently what I'm using to write this article. 

If you don't have a specific preference, go ahead and download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

---

After you have successfully install an IDE, open it. I will use vscode (Visual Studio Code) as example. 


Here is the welcome page of vscode. This is Windows system, if you are using a different operating system like MacOS the page layout might be slightly different.

# Step 2
Wouldn't it be so much better if you could get familiar with GitHub Pages while learning how to use an IDE?


Now I will be using this project as an example. First, create a new folder somewhere in your computer. Next, you will want to open this folder in vscode.


Open vscode, go to Settings, select File -> Open Folder... If you don't know how to do this, you can try the hot-key instead: `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + O`. That will also do Open Folder for you. Next, locate your folder and open it.

---

After you have done that, you will be prompted with a greeting window like below.


![open-folder](/static/img/2-softwares/cyber-spatula/open-folder.png)


Click 'Yes, I trust the authors' to continue. 

---

Next I want you to open a **terminal** within vscode. Go to Settings, select Terminal -> New Terminal. Its hotkey is <code>Ctrl + Shift + `</code>. The last key is called a [backtick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick). 


You should see something like this


![terminal](/static/img/2-softwares/cyber-spatula/terminal.png)

---

Within this panel, you can enter commands and the computer will do some works based on the command you typed in. Now we will want to [clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). This essentially means that you will download a folder from the internet. In this case, we want to clone [this repository](https://github.com/cyberspatula/cyberspatula.github.io.git) and we can achieve this through the terminal.


In the terminal, type this and hit enter
{% highlight shell %}
git clone https://github.com/cyberspatula/cyberspatula.github.io.git
{% endhighlight %}


![git-command](/static/img/2-softwares/cyber-spatula/git-command.png)


You should see a new folder being created in the folder you created.


![git-command2](/static/img/2-softwares/cyber-spatula/git-command2.png)


üìç Troubleshoot: If you see errors like git has not been installed in your computer, you should go to [the official git website](https://git-scm.com/) and download git from there. Follow the instructions and you should be good. 

---

Now check the files in `cyberspatula.github.io`, see if you can make sense what each of them is supposed to be doing. The files are located on the left side of the window of vscode. You can expand a folder by clicking on it. Click a file to view it in vscode.


üë®‚Äçüî¨ Challenge: try if you can find the file that contains contents in this page. (Hint: use 'file search' in vscode)

---

I have already filled `cyberspatula.github.io` with a lot of things. You should be able to use it by **running a local server**. It essentially means that you will be able to open a website and your computer is going to be its server. Other people won't be able to see this website.


You will have to type in several commands this time. If you are on Mac, you might need to do some extra works in order to use [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). It's the programming language that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) uses, and we will be using Jekyll to format our website.


You should check if you already have Ruby. Type this command in the terminal and hit enter.
{% highlight shell %}
ruby -v
{% endhighlight %}


# Install Ruby
On Windows, if you don't have Ruby, you should download it from [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and follow the instructions and you should be good.


On Mac, you are guaranteed to have Ruby. BUT, your Ruby version is likely to be old, like 2.6 something. We want it to be at least 3.0 above. This problem cannot be resolved by just updating Ruby because your MacOS is actually relying on it. One way to solve this is by using something called [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby). 


1 . Install chruby via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). That means you should type the following in the terminal and hit enter.
{% highlight shell %}
brew install chruby
{% endhighlight %}

2 . The other way to install it is via the source code. Try this way if the above didn't work. Clone this repository
{% highlight shell %}
git clone https://github.com/postmodern/chruby.git
{% endhighlight %}
- Go to the `chruby` folder by entering
{% highlight shell %}
cd chruby
{% endhighlight %}

- Run the installation script
{% highlight shell %}
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

3 . Install `ruby-install`. Again, it's possible to install this via Homebrew.
{% highlight shell %}
brew install ruby-install
{% endhighlight %}

4 . Or you can do it manually if the above didn't work.
{% highlight shell %}
git clone https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install.git
cd ruby-install
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

5 . The next step could be a little difficult for you if you have never had programming experience before. In this step you will want to use a text editor like nano or vim. It's not important which one you choose. In this case I will choose vim. You can use them by enter the command and hit enter. This will open a text editor in terminal.
{% highlight shell %}
vim ~./zshrc
{% endhighlight %}
- Replace with nano if you want to use nano. Replace with `~./bashrc` if you are using bash shell.


üìç **It's going to be a little tricky to use vim text editor.** First of all, you need to enter the insertion mode by typing `i` on your keyboard. Then you start typing in the editor. After you are done, hit `Esc` on your keyboard. Then enter `:wq` to save the changes and exit from vim.


6 . Enter the following text via vim, then save and exit from it.
{% highlight shell %}
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
{% endhighlight %}


7 . After you are back in the terminal. Enter the following and hit enter.
{% highlight shell %}
source ~./zshrc
{% endhighlight %}
- Replace with `~./bashrc` if you are using bash shell.


8 . Enter the following and hit enter.
{% highlight shell %}
ruby-install ruby 3.1.1
{% endhighlight %}


9 . Use chruby to switch your current ruby version to 3.1.1
{% highlight shell %}
chruby ruby-3.1.1
{% endhighlight %}


10 . Verify you have successfully switched the Ruby version
{% highlight shell %}
ruby -v
{% endhighlight %}
You should see something like `ruby 3.1.1`. Be sure to perform online searches or inquiry ChatGPT if you encounter any problems not covered here.

---

Now, after you have installed Ruby. I want you to go back to `cyberspatula.github.io`. If you are lost where you are, you can do Open Folder again in vscode. Open the terminal again and enter this command and hit enter.
{% highlight shell %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}
This installs all dependencies in `cyberspatula.github.io`. 


Next, run this command to **start the local server**.
{% highlight shell %}
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}


If the above one didn't work, try this instead
{% highlight shell %}
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}


You can check whether it worked or not by typing `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in a web browser like Safari, Google Chrome...

üéâ That wasn't so bad, huh?


# Step 3
