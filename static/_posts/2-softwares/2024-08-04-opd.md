## Introduction

The Oxford Picture Dictionary was made based on [The New Oxford Picture Dictionary: Monolingual English Edition](https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/OxfordPictureDictionary.pdf) by Parnwell et al. at Oxford University Press. In the first paragraph of the Preface, the authors have described the book as:

> The *New Oxford Picture Dictionary* contextually illustrates over 2,400 words. The book is a unique language learning tool for students of English. It provides students a glance at American lifestyle, as well as compendium of useful vocabulary.

## Adding new content
# New scenario (English)
1. Go to `Assets`, add your new image to `pages` folder. Rename the image to `p104` if it's not already existing. Otherwise, use `p105` and so on. Make sure the numbers are consecutive.
2. Go to `ContentView.swift`, change the field `isUsingDrag` to `1`.
3. In `ContentView.swift`, change the field `langManager`'s `defaultPage` to the number of the page you just added. Ex. `defaultPage: 104` if your image is named `p104`.
4. Choose a simulator (highly recommend iPads for higher precision) and run the project.
5. You should now see something like below after everything has been fully loaded. Next, drag the red dot located in the left-upper corner of the image to anywhere you like.
![pic3](/static/img/2-softwares/opd/pic3.png)
6. Check the XCode console, you should see a position being printed whenever you finish dragging. Ex. `0.5954198473282443,0.10178117048346055`
7. Find the `WordsPosition` folder in the project. Add a new file with exact the same name as the image you just added. (i.e. name your file `p104` if your image is named `p104`)
8. In the newly created file, add `XPosition,YPosition` as the first line of the file.
9. Copy the position from the console and paste it to the next line of the file. If you are uncertain, you can inspect the existing files in `WordsPosition`. After you finish this step, the position of the new word is completed.
10. Now add the actual word. To do so, locate folder `Words-en` in the project, add a new file in it ang give it name `p104-en` if your image is named `p104`.
11. Within the newly created file, enter the title of the scenario in the first line. (ex. People and Relationships)
12. In the next line, enter the actual word. (ex. husband)
13. Repeat steps 5-12 to add more words to the scenario. Again, if you are uncertain, you can inspect the existing files in `Words-en`.
14. Congratulations! You have just added an English Scenario. Now go back to `ContentView.swift` and change field `isUsingDrag` to `0`.
15. Run the project. Since in step 3, you have changed the default page to `104`(...or some other number), the first page you will see should be the scenario you just added. Now you can try to play it with `en-US` or `en-UK` to see if it actually works.
16. If you want the default page to start from `2`, change it in the field `langManager`, like you did in step 3.

<br>
* You might be wondering why the pages starts from `2`, this is because I was following the book, and it was designed this way.

# Translate to (existing) languages
1. Read and follow the above section 'New scenario (English)'. 
2. Using Chinese as example, locate folder `Words-zh-Hans` (Simplified Chinese) or `Words-zh-Hant` (Traditional Chinese). 
3. Similar to the step 10 in the last section. If your image is named `p104`, add a new file and name it `p104-zh-Hans` (inside `Words-zh-Hans`) or name it `p104-zh-Hant` (inside `Words-zh-Hant`).
4. Similar to the step 11 and 12 in the last section. Add a title. (ex. ‰∫∫ÈôÖÂÖ≥Á≥ª) and words in the next lines (ex. ‰∏àÂ§´)
5. It's done! Now run the project and switch to Chinese to see if it works.

# Adding a new language
1. Locate file `enum/Lang.swift`, inside enum `Lang`, add a new case. The case should be the abbreviation of your language, and you should also assign a string value to it. This value will be the name of the icon of your new language. (ex. `ja-JP` for Japanese)
2. That being said, go to `Assets` and add the icon under folder `lang`. Give it the same name as the  string value.
3. Locate `Language/LangManager.swift` and find the private function `csvNameSuffix`. Next, find the inner function `getSuffix`, add the new case to the switch statement. The case should be the abbreviation of your language (which was added by you) and the case should return the suffix of the word folder. (That is, where the words are stored. ex. If it returns `"en"`, the folder it associates should be named `Words-en`, If it returns `"ja"`,  the folder it associates should be named `Words-ja`) 
4. That being said, create a new folder to store the words for your language. You should name it `Words-[abbr. of your language]` (ex. `Words-ja` for Japanese).
5. Now your new language should be added. Remember, if you are uncertain, you can inspect and mimic the existing languages to see how things should be done.

<br>
* This project is using Swift's [built-in Speech system](https://gist.github.com/Koze/d1de49c24fc28375a9e314c72f7fdae4), which means only the supported languages will have speech feature available. Moreover, you should name the string value and image according to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Koze/d1de49c24fc28375a9e314c72f7fdae4) to enable speech for your language. 

## Share the app
This app is offered entirely free as an English learning tool, in recognition of Oxford University Press's generosity in sharing educational resources. In that spirit, **I encourage all derivative works based on this app to also be made freely available and open to the public.** Beyond that, you are welcome to build upon and expand this project with your own ideas.
