## Introduction
This is the very first thing we are going to do for a [big plan](/svz-battle/)! Today we will be reading the player's health point from a health bar using Computer Graphics techniques. You should be able to apply what you will be learning to most of the basic health bars. 

Before we get into the tutorial, we need to understand what exactly is a health bar to us. 
1. It represents the health point of something (e.g. Your character) and it usually consists of a filling area and a background. 
2. Larger the filling area means more health. The filling area and the background usually have different colors. 
3. Sometime a numerical representation is shown next to the health bar, and it would be much easier to read that instead (but unfortunately we don't have that in this case).
4. The color of the filling area and background could be complex! Luckily in this case it's simple. If you are working with some very interest cases you will have to do some additional tricks / use [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org/) to read the value.


## The general idea
