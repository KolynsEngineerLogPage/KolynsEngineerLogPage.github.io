## Introduction
Today we'll being reading the cooldown values of allies and skills in SvZ defense. The word 'cooldown' in a game generally means to recharge for the next use. In this case, an ally will be put to cooldown after an deployment. A skill will be put to cooldown after a cast. When an ally is in cooldown, you won't be able to deploy the same ally. When a skill is in cooldown, you won't be able to cast it. You will have to wait until the cooldown is over, and the waiting time is what we are interested today.


To be more specific, we need to extract the cooldown value from in-game icons.

Notice in this example, on the left we have just got into cooldown. On the right we have the cooldown over. **The less dark overlay area the closer is being done.** 


## The Plan
I have tried many ways to implement for this problem. They can be boiled down to two things: getting approximations (fast & enough for AI training) and getting the exact values (more accurate but slower). In this tutorial I will teach you how to get the exact values because it's harder to do and could be more useful if you intend to use the technique on other games.


Maybe it was a little arrogant to say 'getting the exact values'. Image processing cannot get you there. Ultimately we are still trying to get approximations. BTW getting the exact values is even more difficult in SvZ defense because the icons are transparent when put to cooldown. You'll see what I mean by that...


Enough of that. Now let's get to the plan. Based on observations we can see that the icons are all circular. Since we will be working with the icon heavily, it's better to crop out that region.
