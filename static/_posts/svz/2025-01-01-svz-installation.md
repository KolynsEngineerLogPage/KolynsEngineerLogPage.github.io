Recently, I have been playing this game called Samurai vs Zombies Defense, and it's one of my childhood games. Currently, the players can only access this game through an emulator because the game's provider Glu has stopped its support of this game. **Disclaimer: Install things at your own risk! I won't be responsible for any damage caused by following this tutorial. This article is purely for guidance, and the ultimate decision on whether to proceed is yours!**

## Installation
# Step 1
Go to the [official BlueStacks website](https://www.bluestacks.com/) and download BlueStacks app to your PC.
# Step 2
After you installed BlueStacks, you should see an app called BlueStacks Multi-Instance Manager, from there you can create new Android emulators (and you can run multiple instances at the same time). When choosing an Android verion, I recommend **Nougat 64-bit** because this version seems to be the most stable based on my tests.
# Step 3
After you created the new emulator, open it and locate Chrome. Search for apkcombo and install its APK DOWNLOADER (should be on the top navigation bar of the website). 
# Step 4
In the apkcombo website, search SAMURAI vs ZOMBIES DEFENSE in the search bar and find the game (v 3.4.0), then download XAPK (235 MB). A XAPK is APK with obb signature (a proof of you own this game). This detail is not important if you are just installing the normal game (which is what we have been doing now).
# Step 5
Open APKCombo Installer, click 'Install', locate and install the .xapk file. Volia! You can play Samurai vs Zombies now.

## Installation (Modded)
Here is a bonus: in modded version, you will have unlimited coins and Glu credits. However, it can be **potentially dangerous**, again, you are the one who ultimately decided whether you need it or not.

# Step 1
Finish steps 1 - 3 in the normal installation section.
# Step 2
Open Chrome and go to sbenny.com, search for Samurai vs Zombies. Find the latest post by Sbenny on this topic. You should find four installables. The first two are for normal version SvZ. The next two are for modded version SvZ.
# Step 3
Create an account on sbenny.com and download the modded version. 
# Step 4
Open Google Play Store and download File manager (anything that can manage files on Android device)
# Step 5
Open File manager and unzip the zip file (one of the two downloaded files). Put the item **inside** the unzipped folder into directory Android/obb. This step is necessary to give the game a signature on the emulator.
# Step 6
Same as step 5 in the normal installation section, but this time you choose to install the modded version.
